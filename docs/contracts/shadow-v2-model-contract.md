# Shadow V2-DIFF Model Contract

This document defines the technical requirements for the next-generation shadow model used by the `shadow_generator` stage.

The target model variant is:

- stage key: `shadow_generator`
- model variant: `v2-diff`
- primary execution backend: `triton`
- fallback during development: `local` or `mock`

The document is intentionally written as a training, export, and serving contract. A model checkpoint is not considered integration-ready until it satisfies this contract or explicitly documents an approved deviation.

## Goal

The model generates a physically plausible shadow layer for a foreground object already extracted from the source image.

The model must learn to condition on:

- object appearance
- object alpha mask
- estimated depth
- estimated normals
- light azimuth
- light elevation
- softness
- optional reflection control

The output is not the final composed image. The output is a standalone shadow layer that the ML core compositor can place under the cutout.

## Non-Goals

The model must not own:

- object detection
- segmentation
- foreground colour refinement
- final background composition
- output image encoding
- request parsing or API validation

Those responsibilities remain in the ML core pipeline.

## Canonical Input Contract

The ML core passes the shadow model a canonical working-canvas crop after detection, crop, pad, resize, segmentation, foreground refinement, depth, and normals.

All image-like inputs must share the same spatial size.

Recommended first production size:

- `512 x 512`

The model implementation should avoid hard-coding this size internally unless the exported artifact clearly declares the supported shape.

### Tensor Inputs

| Name | Required | Shape | Dtype | Range | Layout | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `img` | yes | `[N, 4, H, W]` | `FP32` | `0..1` | `NCHW` | Refined RGBA object cutout on transparent background. |
| `mask` | yes | `[N, 1, H, W]` | `FP32` | `0..1` | `NCHW` | Foreground alpha/object mask. |
| `depth` | yes | `[N, 1, H, W]` | `FP32` | `0..1` | `NCHW` | Relative depth map on the canonical crop. |
| `normal` | yes | `[N, 3, H, W]` | `FP32` | `0..1` | `NCHW` | Normal map encoded as RGB-like XYZ remap. |
| `angle` | yes | `[N]` or `[N, 1]` | `FP32` | degrees | scalar | Light azimuth in degrees. |
| `elevation` | yes | `[N]` or `[N, 1]` | `FP32` | degrees | scalar | Light elevation above horizon in degrees. |
| `softness` | yes | `[N]` or `[N, 1]` | `FP32` | `0..1` | scalar | Learned shadow edge softness control. |
| `reflection` | yes | `[N]` or `[N, 1]` | `FP32` | `0..1` | scalar | Optional glossy/reflection control. The first model may ignore it, but the tensor must be accepted. |

### Angle Semantics

`angle` is an azimuth in degrees in the product contract.

Training data and inference code must use one documented convention and keep it stable. The recommended convention is:

- `0` means light comes from the right side of the image
- `90` means light comes from the top side of the image
- values increase counter-clockwise in image coordinates
- valid public range is `0..360`

If the training pipeline uses a different convention internally, the conversion must happen before export or inside the model adapter, not in the product API.

### Elevation Semantics

`elevation` is the light height above the horizon in degrees.

Recommended range:

- minimum: `5`
- maximum: `85`

Expected behavior:

- lower elevation produces longer shadows
- higher elevation produces shorter, more compact shadows

### Softness Semantics

`softness` is a conditioning input to the real model.

Important:

- the real `v2-diff` model must not rely on a post-model Gaussian blur to implement softness
- coarse post-blur is allowed only in the `mock` backend
- `softness=0` should produce the sharpest supported shadow
- `softness=1` should produce the softest supported shadow

### Reflection Semantics

`reflection` is reserved for reflective or glossy-floor behavior.

The first checkpoint may ignore the value, but it must:

- accept the input tensor
- keep output stable when reflection is unused
- document whether reflection is active

## Output Contract

The model must produce a standalone shadow tensor.

| Name | Required | Shape | Dtype | Range | Layout | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `shadow` | yes | `[N, 4, H, W]` | `FP32` | `0..1` | `NCHW` | RGBA shadow layer aligned to the canonical working canvas. |

Recommended channel semantics:

- `R,G,B`: shadow colour/tint in straight alpha convention
- `A`: shadow opacity mask

The compositor may use the alpha channel as the primary opacity signal. If RGB is not meaningful in the first checkpoint, RGB should still be valid and preferably represent black or softly tinted shadow colour.

The output must:

- be spatially aligned with all inputs
- keep transparent regions numerically stable
- not include the foreground object
- not include the final background
- not apply final product opacity; global `opacity` remains a compositor-level control

## Training Data Requirements

Each training sample should contain, or be reproducibly converted into:

- foreground RGBA object crop
- foreground mask
- depth map in the same crop coordinates
- normal map in the same crop coordinates
- target shadow RGBA or target shadow alpha plus colour policy
- light azimuth metadata
- light elevation metadata
- softness metadata or estimated softness label
- reflection metadata, even if always `0` initially

Dataset samples must be normalized into the same canonical crop contract used by inference.

### Dataset Quality Gates

Training data should be rejected or quarantined when:

- foreground mask and target shadow are misaligned
- object crop has inconsistent scale or padding
- light labels are missing or visibly wrong
- target shadow includes the object body
- target shadow is baked into the background and cannot be separated reliably
- alpha values are clipped too aggressively for soft edges

### Recommended Dataset Splits

Use object-level and scene-level separation:

- train: `80%`
- validation: `10%`
- test: `10%`

The same object instance should not appear in both train and test unless the explicit goal is same-object relighting.

## Training Behavior Requirements

The model must be controllable.

Validation should include controlled sweeps where only one input changes:

- same object, same depth/normal, different `angle`
- same object, same angle, different `elevation`
- same object, same angle/elevation, different `softness`
- same object, same controls, small mask perturbations

Expected behavior:

- changing `angle` changes shadow direction
- changing `elevation` changes shadow length and placement
- changing `softness` changes penumbra softness without simply blurring the whole output
- transparent and semi-transparent foreground regions produce believable shadow transitions
- output remains stable for thin structures, ears, legs, handles, fur, and other silhouette details

## Recommended Losses and Metrics

Exact architecture is not fixed by this contract, but the training objective should measure both pixel quality and control fidelity.

Recommended losses:

- masked L1 or Charbonnier loss on shadow alpha
- perceptual loss on RGB/tint when RGB shadow colour is meaningful
- gradient or edge-aware loss for contact shadow and penumbra boundaries
- direction consistency loss or auxiliary evaluator for `angle`
- length/scale consistency loss or evaluator for `elevation`
- optional adversarial/diffusion objective for realism

Recommended validation metrics:

- alpha MAE on shadow region
- soft-edge IoU or boundary F-score
- direction error in degrees
- shadow extent error
- contact-region error near object footprint
- LPIPS or similar perceptual metric for RGB shadow layer if applicable
- latency and GPU memory at target batch sizes

## Inference Requirements

The model must support:

- batch size `1`
- batch size `4` as the first Triton dynamic batching target
- deterministic or bounded-stochastic inference mode for production
- stable output for repeated identical inputs when seed/config is fixed

Recommended latency target for first integration:

- batch `1`: less than `1000 ms` on target local GPU
- batch `4`: better throughput than four serial batch-1 calls

These latency numbers are acceptance targets, not hard blockers for early research checkpoints.

## Triton Serving Contract

The long-term serving target is Triton using the standard tensor infer protocol.

Preferred export order:

1. `ONNX` when the architecture supports clean export
2. `TensorRT` optimization after ONNX behavior is stable
3. Triton Python backend only when export is blocked or for research bring-up

The Triton model repository entry should use:

- model name: `shadowgen_shadow_v2`
- model variant: `v2-diff`
- input tensor names exactly matching this contract
- output tensor name: `shadow`
- `max_batch_size`: `4` for first production integration
- dynamic batching enabled with a short queue delay

The ML core currently expects this binding shape:

```text
inputs:
  img:        FP32 [N, 4, H, W]
  mask:       FP32 [N, 1, H, W]
  depth:      FP32 [N, 1, H, W]
  normal:     FP32 [N, 3, H, W]
  angle:      FP32 [N] or [N, 1]
  elevation:  FP32 [N] or [N, 1]
  softness:   FP32 [N] or [N, 1]
  reflection: FP32 [N] or [N, 1]

outputs:
  shadow:     FP32 [N, 4, H, W]
```

## Export Artifact Requirements

Every model release must include:

- model weights or exported model artifact
- model config
- preprocessing contract version
- postprocessing contract version
- input tensor names
- output tensor names
- expected tensor shapes
- normalization rules
- supported image size policy
- supported batch size
- expected runtime backend
- training dataset/version identifier
- validation report
- known limitations

Recommended artifact layout:

```text
shadowgen_shadow_v2/
  1/
    model.onnx
  config.pbtxt
  model-card.md
  validation-report.json
  preprocessing.json
```

For a temporary Python backend:

```text
shadowgen_shadow_v2/
  1/
    model.py
    model/
      weights.safetensors
      config.json
  config.pbtxt
  model-card.md
  validation-report.json
```

Weights and large generated artifacts must not be committed to git.

## Versioning

Use semantic model versions in metadata even if Triton stores numeric version folders.

Recommended naming:

- `v2-diff-research-YYYYMMDD`
- `v2-diff-alpha.1`
- `v2-diff-beta.1`
- `v2-diff-prod.1`

The ML core capability metadata should expose:

- `model_name`
- `model_version`
- `model_variant`
- `backend_kind`
- `device`
- `endpoint`

## Acceptance Checklist

A checkpoint is ready for ML-core integration when:

- it accepts all required tensors by the exact contract names
- it returns `shadow` with shape `[N, 4, H, W]`
- output values are finite and clipped or naturally bounded to `0..1`
- batch `1` works
- batch `4` works or limitation is documented
- angle sweep visibly changes direction
- elevation sweep visibly changes length
- softness sweep visibly changes penumbra behavior
- reflection input is accepted
- inference does not require product API fields beyond this contract
- model card and validation report are included
- at least one smoke sample can be run through the ML core debug path

## Integration Smoke Test

The first integration smoke should run:

1. full sync pipeline with `shadow_generator` requested as `triton/v2-diff`
2. debug stage rerun for `shadow_generator`
3. async render job using the same model
4. fallback test with Triton unavailable

Expected debug metadata:

- `requested_backend_kind = triton`
- `actual_backend_kind = triton`
- `model_variant = v2-diff`
- `model_name = shadowgen_shadow_v2`
- `endpoint` is filled
- `fallback_reason = null`

## Open Decisions

The following decisions may be finalized after first training experiments:

- whether RGB shadow colour is predicted directly or fixed by compositor policy
- whether `normal` should use `0..1` encoded XYZ or `-1..1` internal conversion
- whether the first production model is diffusion, conditional U-Net, or another architecture
- whether reflection becomes an active learned control in the first checkpoint
- whether canonical size remains `512x512` or moves to a larger working canvas
